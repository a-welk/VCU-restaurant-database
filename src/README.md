# Computer Science 508 Fall Semester Project Source Code
## Overview

These source code files represent the fundamental building blocks of our CMSC 508 Fall Semester Project, specifically catering to the implementation and functionality of our database solution tailored to resolve dining challenges encountered by VCU students. Within this set, the 'project-flask.py' file serves as the core Flask application, orchestrating the communication between our database and the API endpoints. The 'restaurant_directory-ddl.sql' and 'restaurant_directory-dml.sql' files encompass the database schema and populate it with initial sample data, laying the foundation for testing and implementation.
