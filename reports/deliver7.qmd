# Problem Description

## Problem Domain

The problem domain we're addressing involves VCU students' dining choices, specifically those who struggle to find affordable dining options that match their cravings while staying within their budget. Many students face the challenge of balancing their culinary preferences with limited financial resources. This issue is common on the campus of Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in Richmond, and it can be a hassle to locate nearby dining options.

## Need 

The database was meticulously crafted to tackle the dining challenges faced by VCU students by consolidating comprehensive information about local restaurants, their menus, pricing, notable dishes, dietary preferences, visitor reviews, and less than mile distance from campus. It stands as a centralized hub providing students with a wealth of dining options, catering to individual cravings, financial constraints, infromation on preferences for nearby dining establishments. The database is geared towards elevating the dining experience for VCU students. It streamlines the process of discovering satisfying meals within budgetary limits and close proximity, eliminating the hassle of extensive travel for dining.


## Context, Scope, and Perspective

The database is primarily designed for VCU students. Its perspective represents the student population at VCU who encounter challenges in finding suitable dining options on and around campus. It aims to empower students by offering a user-friendly platform tailored to their preferences and needs, including the convenience of locating nearby restaurants. 

## User roles and use cases

The database caters to various user roles, including VCU students, local restaurant owners, and administrators. VCU students primarily use the database to discover nearby restaurants, explore menu offerings, and find dietary preferences, helping them make informed dining choices. Restaurant owners input and manage information about their establishments, ensuring accurate representation. Administrators oversee the database's functionality and data quality. The database serves as a standalone platform, but it can be integrated with VCU's existing systems to enhance the student experience by providing location-based dining information.


## Security and Privacy

In our database design, we're planning to take robust measures to protect our restaurant's proprietary information, which includes critical data like restaurant locations, pricing, and our unique menu offerings. We understand that this information is not only a valuable asset but also essential to our competitive advantage. To secure it, we intend to establish stringent access controls. Our approach will involve implementing role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized individual can access or modify this vital data. By taking these steps, we aim to maintain the integrity of our business model and data, making sure it remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access.

**Constraints**

- Primary keys enforce uniqueness and identify each record.
- Foreign keys establish relationships between tables.
- Attribute domains define the data types for each attribute.

## Functional Dependencies and Normalization

### Functional Dependencies

Let's analyze the functional dependencies (FDs) in the proposed database schema:

1. In the **Restaurants** relation:
   - `restaurant_id` $\rightarrow$ `restaurant_name`, `restaurant_location_id`

2. In the **Location** relation:
   - `location_id` $\rightarrow$ `location_address`, `location_neighborhood`, `location_direction_from_VCU`

3. In the **Menu** relation:
   - `menu_id` $\rightarrow$ `restaurant_id`

4. In the **Items** relation:
   - `item_id` $\rightarrow$ `item_name`, `item_description`, `item_price`, `item_dietary_preference_id`

5. In the **Accessibility** relation:
   - `accessibility_id` $\rightarrow$ `accessibility_restaurant_id`, `accessibility_nearby_bus_stops`, `accessibility_notes`

6. In the **Reviews** relation:
   - `review_id` $\rightarrow$ `review_restaurant_id`, `review_rating`, `review_text`

7. In the **Dietary Preference** relation:
   - `dietary_preference_id` $\rightarrow$ `dietary_preference_name`

### Normalization to BCNF

To achieve Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), we ensure that for any non-trivial FD, the left-hand side (LHS) is a superkey. The decomposition of the schema into BCNF is as follows:

- **Restaurants**, **Location**, **Menu**, **Items**, **Accessibility**, **Reviews**, and **Dietary Preference** remain as is, as their FDs hold for their primary keys.

- The other tables do not require further decomposition as their FDs adhere to BCNF.

### Decomposition

Here's a summary of the decomposition and their respective functional dependencies:

* $R_{0}(\text{Restaurant ID}, \text{Name}, \text{Location ID})$ having FD(s): $\text{Restaurant ID} \rightarrow \text{Name}$ and $\text{Location ID} \rightarrow \text{Address, Neighborhood, Cardinal Direction from VCU}$
  - Explanation: 
    - $R_{0}$ represents the `restaurants` table and its dependencies.
    - `Restaurant ID` uniquely determines `Name`.
    - `Location ID` uniquely determines `Address`, `Neighborhood`, and `Cardinal Direction from VCU`.

- $R_{1}(\text{Location ID}, \text{Address}, \text{Neighborhood}, \text{Cardinal Direction from VCU})$ having FD(s): No additional functional dependencies
  - Explanation:
    - $R_{1}$ corresponds to the `locations` table, capturing location-specific details.
    - No additional functional dependencies exist within this relation.

- $R_{2}(\text{Menu ID}, \text{Restaurant ID}, \text{Type})$ having FD(s): $\text{Restaurant ID} \rightarrow \text{Type}$
  - Explanation:
    - $R_{2}$ pertains to the `menu` table and its dependency on restaurant IDs.
    - `Restaurant ID` determines `Type` within this relation.

- $R_{3}(\text{Item ID}, \text{Item Name}, \text{Description}, \text{Price}, \text{Dietary Preference ID})$ having FD(s): $\text{Dietary Preference ID} \rightarrow \text{Preference Name}$
  - Explanation:
    - $R_{3}$ reflects the `items` table and its dependencies.
    - `Dietary Preference ID` determines `Preference Name` uniquely in this context.

- $R_{4}(\text{Accessibility ID}, \text{Restaurant ID}, \text{Nearby Bus Stops}, \text{Sidewalk Availability})$ having FD(s): $\text{Restaurant ID} \rightarrow \text{Name}$
  - Explanation:
    - $R_{4}$ doesn't directly align but demonstrates a dependency similar to the accessibility details, reflecting restaurant names based on `Restaurant ID`.

- $R_{5}(\text{Review ID}, \text{Restaurant ID}, \text{Rating}, \text{Review Text})$ having FD(s): $\text{Restaurant ID} \rightarrow \text{Name}$
  - Explanation:
    - $R_{5}$ mirrors the `reviews` table, indicating dependencies related to restaurant names based on `Restaurant ID`.

## API Definition

### Accessing the Database

Your database is accessible through a RESTful API. The following endpoints allow access to the database:


### API Demonstration

A demonstration of the API's functionality can be showcased using tools like cURL or Postman. Here's an example:
- Using cURL: `curl -X GET http://your-api-endpoint/restaurants`
- Using Postman: Create a GET request to `http://your-api-endpoint/restaurants`

## Source Code Links

- [DDL SQL Code](https://github.com/cmsc-vcu/cmsc508-fa2023-prj-restaurantdirectory-group21/blob/main/src/restaurantdirectory-ddl.sql)
- [DML SQL Code](https://github.com/cmsc-vcu/cmsc508-fa2023-prj-restaurantdirectory-group21/blob/main/src/restaurantdirectory-dml.sql)
- [API Source Code](https://github.com/cmsc-vcu/cmsc508-fa2023-prj-restaurantdirectory-group21/blob/main/src/project-flask.py)

## Future Considerations

- Implementing user authentication and authorization for API access.
- Optimizing endpoint responses by implementing pagination and filtering.
- Already have locations table to account for restaurants that have multiple locations however case was not present in our current dataset.

## Reflections on the Project

The project went well overall. The initial goals were mostly achieved. If given more time to work on this we could have extended our search to a greater radius however we are happy with the amount that we were able to complete.
