# Computer Science 508 Fall Semester Project Reports

These reports serve as the foundation of our CMSC 508 Fall Semester Project, which focuses on designing a database solution to address dining challenges faced by VCU students. In this first phase, our reports encompass all aspects of our project, from understanding the problem domain and justifying the need for a database to the intricacies of database design and project management.
