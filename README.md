# Computer Science 508 Fall Semester Project: Restaurant Database

Our database project revolves around addressing the dining challenges that VCU students often encounter. We've created a platform that compiles a wealth of information about local restaurants, including their menus, prices, special dishes, dietary options, student discounts, user reviews, and proximity to campus. The idea is to empower VCU students to make well-informed dining choices that cater to their specific cravings, financial constraints, and the convenience of being close to campus. Our project is motivated by the desire to alleviate the dining dilemmas that many students face during their college years, not just at VCU but potentially at other universities as well.
